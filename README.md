Lean
====
The PHP framework for simple, REST API backends. It gets out of your way, so you can get your work done.
Quite similar to [Laravel](http://github.com/laravel/laravel), but much easier, only not as matured.
The overall objective is to achieve less clutter on the server, and to move as much application logic to the client.
Hence, this is best suited to provisioning JSON APIs, at the moment.
